# BAC (Bids and Awards Committee) Guide

As a **BAC (Bids and Awards Committee) member**, you play a crucial role in reviewing procurement-related disbursement vouchers. This guide explains the unique multi-reviewer process and how to complete your review responsibilities.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding BAC's role in the GSO workflow
- How the multi-reviewer system works
- Completing your three-stage review process
- Tracking individual BAC member actions
- Understanding when BAC review is complete

## Prerequisites

- ✅ You have logged into the system
- ✅ Your account has the BAC role
- ✅ You understand procurement review requirements
- ✅ A GSO voucher has been approved by the Mayor and is awaiting BAC review

## Understanding BAC's Role

### Why BAC Review Exists

The Bids and Awards Committee reviews procurement vouchers to ensure:
- Proper procurement procedures were followed
- Competitive bidding requirements are met
- Best value for government funds
- Compliance with procurement regulations

### When BAC Review Happens

BAC review occurs in the **GSO workflow**:
1. GSO creates a procurement voucher
2. Secretary reviews and forwards
3. Mayor approves and forwards
4. **BAC reviews** (multiple members)
5. Budget reviews
6. Accounting reviews
7. Treasury processes payment

:::info GSO Only
BAC review is **only** for vouchers created by GSO users. Regular office vouchers (from Requesters) and HR vouchers do not go through BAC review.
:::

## Multi-Reviewer System

### Understanding the Requirement

The BAC review requires **multiple members** to review independently:
- **Default requirement**: 3 BAC members must complete review
- **Configurable**: System administrator can change this number
- **Individual tracking**: Each BAC member has their own review process

### How It Works

1. **Multiple members review simultaneously**: Each BAC member can review at their own pace
2. **Individual actions tracked**: Each member's RECEIVED, REVIEWED, and FORWARDED actions are tracked separately
3. **Progress displayed**: You can see how many members have completed each stage
4. **Completion requirement**: All required members must complete review before the voucher moves to Budget

### Viewing Required Approvals

When you open a voucher requiring BAC review, you'll see:
- **"X out of Y approvers"** status
- Example: "2 out of 3 approvers" means 2 members have completed, 1 more is needed
- Individual BAC member progress in the approval progress bar

## Receiving Notifications

### When You Get Notified

You'll receive a notification when:
- A GSO voucher is approved by the Mayor and ready for BAC review
- Another BAC member completes their review (for visibility)
- The voucher moves to the next stage after all BAC reviews are complete

### Checking Your Notifications

1. Look for the **notification bell** (🔔) in the top navigation
2. Click it to see pending BAC reviews
3. Click a notification to open the voucher

## The Three-Stage Review Process

As a BAC member, you follow the same three-stage process as other reviewers, but your actions are tracked individually.

### Stage 1: RECEIVED

**What it means**: You acknowledge receipt of the voucher for review

**How to do it**:
1. Open the voucher that needs BAC review
2. Review the voucher details, items, and supporting information
3. Click the **"Received"** button
4. Optionally add a comment: "Received for BAC review"
5. Click **"Confirm"** or **"Save"**

**What happens**:
- Your "Received" action is recorded with timestamp
- The voucher shows you've received it
- Other BAC members can see your action
- The voucher remains available for other BAC members

:::tip Individual Tracking
Each BAC member's "Received" action is tracked separately. You don't need to wait for others—you can mark it as received whenever you're ready.
:::

### Stage 2: REVIEWED

**What it means**: You've completed your review of the voucher

**When to do it**: After you've thoroughly reviewed:
- All line items and quantities
- Prices and calculations
- Procurement documentation
- Compliance with procurement rules

**How to do it**:
1. Ensure you've reviewed all voucher details
2. Click the **"Reviewed"** button
3. **Add review comments** (recommended):
   - Note any findings
   - Document compliance verification
   - Add any concerns or observations
4. Click **"Confirm"** or **"Save"**

**What happens**:
- Your "Reviewed" action is recorded
- Your comments are added to the activity log
- Other BAC members can see your review completion
- The voucher shows your review status

:::warning Review Thoroughly
Take time to review carefully. Your review ensures proper procurement procedures were followed.
:::

### Stage 3: FORWARDED

**What it means**: You've completed your review and are forwarding it (conceptually, as part of the group decision)

**When to do it**: After you've:
- Completed your review
- Verified compliance
- Added any necessary comments
- Determined the voucher is ready to proceed

**Important Note**: The voucher only moves to Budget after **all required BAC members** have completed their three stages.

**How to do it**:
1. Ensure you've completed RECEIVED and REVIEWED stages
2. Click the **"Forwarded"** button
3. Optionally add final comments
4. Click **"Confirm"** or **"Save"**

**What happens**:
- Your "Forwarded" action is recorded
- The system tracks: "X out of Y BAC members have forwarded"
- When all required members forward, the voucher automatically moves to Budget
- You'll see a notification when BAC review is complete

## Understanding Button States

### When Buttons Are Enabled

- **Received**: Always available when voucher is at BAC stage
- **Reviewed**: Available after you've marked as Received
- **Forwarded**: Available after you've marked as Reviewed

### When Buttons Are Disabled

- If you haven't completed the previous stage
- If the voucher has moved past BAC stage
- If the voucher is cancelled

### "Awaiting Previous Review" Message

If you see this message, it means:
- The voucher hasn't reached BAC stage yet
- Wait for Mayor approval to complete
- Check the approval progress to see current stage

## Viewing Other BAC Members' Progress

### In the Approval Progress Bar

The progress bar shows:
- Each BAC member individually
- Their current stage (Received, Reviewed, Forwarded)
- Timestamps for each action
- Overall BAC completion status

### In the Activity Log

The activity log shows:
- All BAC member actions
- Who performed each action
- When it happened
- Comments added by each member

### Understanding Individual vs. Department Completion

**Important distinction**:
- **Individual completion**: You complete your own RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED
- **Department completion**: All required BAC members must complete before the voucher moves forward

You can complete your review even if others haven't started. The system tracks everyone individually.

## Adding Review Comments

### Why Comments Matter

Comments help:
- Document your review findings
- Explain any concerns or observations
- Provide context for other reviewers
- Create a complete audit trail

### How to Add Comments

1. When clicking **Reviewed** or **Forwarded**, you'll see a comment field
2. Enter your comments:
   - "Verified procurement procedures followed"
   - "All items comply with bidding requirements"
   - "No issues found, ready to proceed"
3. Comments are saved to the activity log

### Best Practices for Comments

✅ **Be specific**: "Verified three bids received as required"
✅ **Be professional**: Use formal language appropriate for official records
✅ **Be clear**: Explain your findings or decisions
❌ **Don't be vague**: Avoid "OK" or "Looks good" without context

## Understanding Completion Status

### "X out of Y Approvers" Display

This shows:
- **X**: Number of BAC members who have completed all three stages
- **Y**: Total number of BAC members required
- Example: "2 out of 3 approvers" means 2 have completed, 1 more needed

### When BAC Review is Complete

BAC review is complete when:
- All required BAC members (default: 3) have completed RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED
- The voucher automatically moves to Budget stage
- You'll see a notification
- The approval progress bar shows BAC as 100% complete

### What Happens Next

After BAC review completes:
1. Budget office receives notification
2. Budget review begins
3. Voucher continues through remaining workflow stages

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You're the First BAC Member to Review

1. You receive notification
2. You mark as Received
3. You complete Reviewed
4. You mark as Forwarded
5. Status shows "1 out of 3 approvers"
6. Other members can now see your progress

### Scenario 2: Other Members Have Already Started

1. You receive notification
2. You see "1 out of 3 approvers" in status
3. You can view other members' actions in activity log
4. You complete your own three stages
5. Status updates to "2 out of 3 approvers"

### Scenario 3: All Members Complete Review

1. Final member completes their review
2. Status changes to "3 out of 3 approvers"
3. Voucher automatically moves to Budget
4. All BAC members receive notification
5. Budget office receives notification

## Tips for Effective BAC Review

1. **Review Promptly**: Don't delay—other members may be waiting
2. **Be Thorough**: Check all items, prices, and documentation
3. **Document Findings**: Add comments explaining your review
4. **Coordinate if Needed**: Communicate with other BAC members outside the system if needed
5. **Follow Procedures**: Ensure compliance with procurement regulations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Skipping stages**: Always complete RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED in order
❌ **Not adding comments**: Document your review findings
❌ **Waiting for others**: You can review independently—don't wait
❌ **Rushing review**: Take time to verify compliance
❌ **Not checking all items**: Review every line item carefully

## Troubleshooting
