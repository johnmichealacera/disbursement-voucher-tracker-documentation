# Requester Guide

## What You'll Learn

- How to create a disbursement voucher
- Understanding the voucher creation form
- Saving vouchers as drafts vs. submitting for review
- Tracking your vouchers through the approval process
- Understanding status badges and progress

## Prerequisites

- ✅ You have logged into the system
- ✅ Your account has the REQUESTER role
- ✅ You know the payee information for your voucher
- ✅ You have the payment details ready (amount, particulars)

## Creating a Disbursement Voucher

### Step 1: Access the Create Request Page

1. Look for the **"Create Request"** or **"New Voucher"** option in the navigation menu
2. Click on it to open the voucher creation form
3. You'll see a form with several fields to fill out

:::tip Quick Access
You can also access the create page from your dashboard if there's a "Create New Voucher" button or card.
:::

### Step 2: Fill Out Basic Information

The voucher creation form has several sections. Let's go through each one:

#### Payee Information

**Payee Name** (Required):
- Click in the **Payee** field
- Start typing the payee's name
- A dropdown list will appear showing matching payees from the directory
- Select the correct payee from the list
- If the payee doesn't exist, you may see a **"Quick Add"** or **"Add New"** option (if enabled)

:::info Payee Directory
The system uses a payee directory to ensure consistency. If you can't find a payee, contact your administrator to add them to the directory.
:::

**Payee Address** (Required):
- Enter the complete address of the payee
- Include street address, city, and other relevant details
- This address will appear on the voucher

#### Payment Details

**Particulars** (Required):
- Enter a clear description of what the payment is for
- Be specific: "Payment for office supplies - January 2024"
- This helps reviewers understand the purpose of the disbursement

**Amount** (Required):
- Enter the payment amount in Philippine Pesos (₱)
- Use numbers only (no currency symbol needed)
- Example: For ₱5,000.00, enter `5000` or `5000.00`
- The system will format it with currency symbol automatically

:::warning Amount Accuracy
Double-check the amount before submitting. Once approved, changes may require cancellation and recreation of the voucher.
:::

#### Additional Information

**Remarks** (Optional):
- Add any additional notes or explanations
- This can help reviewers understand context
- Example: "Urgent payment required for ongoing project"

**Reference Number** (Optional):
- If you have a reference number from another system or document, enter it here
- This helps with cross-referencing

### Step 3: Review Your Information

Before submitting, review all the information you've entered:
- ✅ Payee name is correct
- ✅ Address is complete and accurate
- ✅ Particulars clearly describe the payment purpose
- ✅ Amount is correct
- ✅ All required fields are filled

### Step 4: Save or Submit

You have two options:

#### Option A: Save as Draft

Click the **"Save as Draft"** button if:
- You need to complete the voucher later
- You're waiting for additional information
- You want to review before submitting

**What happens when you save as draft:**
- The voucher is saved with **DRAFT** status
- You can edit it later
- No notifications are sent
- The voucher doesn't enter the approval workflow

#### Option B: Submit for Review

Click the **"Submit for Review"** button if:
- All information is complete and correct
- You're ready to start the approval process

**What happens when you submit:**
- The voucher status changes to **PENDING**
- The Secretary receives a notification
- The voucher enters the approval workflow
- You can no longer edit the voucher (unless it's returned)

:::tip Best Practice
If you're unsure about any information, save as draft first. You can always submit it later after reviewing or getting clarification.
:::

## Understanding Validation Requirements

The system validates your voucher before allowing submission. Common validation errors:

### Missing Required Fields
- **Error**: "Payee is required"
- **Solution**: Select a payee from the dropdown

### Invalid Amount
- **Error**: "Amount must be greater than zero"
- **Solution**: Enter a valid amount (numbers only, greater than 0)

### Incomplete Information
- **Error**: "Particulars cannot be empty"
- **Solution**: Enter a description of the payment purpose

:::info Validation Help
If you see a validation error, the field with the issue will be highlighted. Fix the error and try submitting again.

## Managing Your Vouchers

### Viewing Your Created Vouchers

1. Navigate to **"My Vouchers"** or **"Disbursements"** in the menu
2. You'll see a list of all vouchers you've created
3. The list shows:
   - Voucher ID/Reference Number
   - Payee Name
   - Amount
   - Status Badge
   - Date Created
   - Current Reviewer

### Understanding Status Badges

Your vouchers will have different status badges:

- **DRAFT** (Gray): Saved but not submitted
- **PENDING** (Yellow): Submitted, awaiting review
- **VALIDATED** (Blue): Initial validation complete
- **APPROVED** (Green): Approved by required authorities
- **RELEASED** (Dark Green): Payment released by Treasury
- **CANCELLED** (Red): Cancelled (by you or an authorized user)

### Editing Draft Vouchers

You can edit vouchers that are in **DRAFT** status:

1. Find the draft voucher in your list
2. Click on it to open the details
3. Click **"Edit"** button
4. Make your changes
5. Click **"Save"** or **"Save as Draft"** again

:::warning Editing Limitations
Once a voucher is submitted (PENDING status or later), you cannot edit it. If changes are needed, you may need to cancel it (if allowed) and create a new one.
:::

## Tracking Voucher Status

### Viewing Approval Progress

1. Open any voucher you've created
2. Look for the **"Approval Progress"** section
3. You'll see a progress bar showing:
   - Current stage in the workflow
   - Percentage complete
   - Which departments have reviewed
   - Timestamps for each stage

### Understanding the Workflow

Your vouchers follow this workflow:

1. **You Create** → DRAFT or PENDING
2. **Secretary Review** → RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED
3. **Mayor Approval** → RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED
4. **Budget Review** → RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED
5. **Accounting Review** → RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED
6. **Treasury Processing** → Check Issuance → Available → Released

### Viewing Activity Log

Each voucher has an **Activity Log** showing:
- Who did what action
- When it happened
- Any comments or remarks added

To view the activity log:
1. Open a voucher
2. Scroll to the **"Activity Log"** section
3. See all actions in chronological order

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Understanding Notifications

You'll receive notifications when:
- Your voucher is approved by a reviewer
- Your voucher is forwarded to the next department
- Your voucher is released by Treasury
- Your voucher needs attention (if returned or cancelled)

### Checking Notifications

1. Look for the **notification bell** icon (🔔) in the top navigation
2. A red badge shows the number of unread notifications
3. Click the bell to see your notifications
4. Click a notification to view the related voucher

:::info Auto-Refresh
Notifications automatically refresh every 30 seconds, so you'll see new notifications without refreshing the page.
:::

## Common Tasks

### Creating Multiple Vouchers

You can create as many vouchers as needed:
1. After creating one voucher, return to the "Create Request" page
2. Fill out the form again with new information
3. Save or submit as needed

### Finding a Specific Voucher

Use the search and filter options:
- **Search**: Enter payee name, voucher ID, or particulars
- **Filter by Status**: Show only drafts, pending, approved, etc.
- **Filter by Date**: Find vouchers from a specific time period

### Viewing Voucher Details

Click on any voucher in your list to see:
- Complete voucher information
- Approval progress
- Activity log
- Current status and reviewer

## Tips for Efficient Voucher Creation

1. **Prepare Information First**: Have all details ready before starting
2. **Use Payee Directory**: Select from directory rather than typing manually
3. **Be Specific in Particulars**: Clear descriptions help reviewers
4. **Save Drafts When Unsure**: Don't submit until information is complete
5. **Check Amounts Twice**: Verify amounts before submitting
6. **Use Remarks**: Add context that might help reviewers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Submitting incomplete information**: Always fill all required fields
❌ **Entering wrong amounts**: Double-check amounts before submitting
❌ **Using vague particulars**: Be specific about payment purpose
❌ **Forgetting to save drafts**: Save work in progress
❌ **Not checking notifications**: Stay informed about voucher status
