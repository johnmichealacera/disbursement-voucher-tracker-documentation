# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Find answers to common questions about using the Disbursement Voucher Tracker.

## General Questions

### What is the Disbursement Voucher Tracker?

The Disbursement Voucher Tracker is a web-based system for creating, reviewing, approving, and tracking disbursement vouchers in municipal government operations. It digitizes the paper-based voucher process and provides real-time tracking and notifications.

### Who can use the system?

The system is designed for municipal government employees with various roles:
- Requesters (department staff)
- GSO and HR staff
- Reviewers (Secretary, Mayor, Budget, Accounting)
- BAC members
- Treasury staff
- Administrators

### Do I need special software to use it?

No special software is needed. You only need:
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Internet connection
- Login credentials from your administrator

### Is my data secure?

Yes. The system uses secure encryption and role-based access control. Only authorized users can view and modify vouchers based on their role and permissions.

## Login and Access

### I forgot my password. What should I do?

Contact your system administrator. They can reset your password and provide you with new login credentials.

### I can't log in. What's wrong?

Common issues:
- **Wrong username or password**: Double-check your credentials, ensure Caps Lock is off
- **Account inactive**: Contact administrator—your account may need activation
- **Browser issue**: Try a different browser or clear cache
- **Internet connection**: Check your connection

### Can I access the system from home?

Yes, if your organization allows remote access. You'll need internet connection and your login credentials. Check with your administrator about remote access policies.

### Why don't I see certain menu options?

Menu options are role-based. You only see options available to your role. This is normal and ensures you only access features you're authorized to use.

## Creating Vouchers

### Can I save a voucher and complete it later?

Yes! Click **"Save as Draft"** to save your work. You can return later to edit and submit it.

### What's the difference between "Save as Draft" and "Submit for Review"?

- **Save as Draft**: Saves voucher but doesn't start approval process. You can edit it later.
- **Submit for Review**: Starts the approval workflow. Voucher becomes PENDING and you can't edit it (unless it's returned).

### Can I edit a voucher after submitting it?

No, once submitted (PENDING status), you cannot edit. If changes are needed, you may need to cancel it (if allowed) and create a new one.

### What if I make a mistake in a draft voucher?

You can edit draft vouchers anytime. Open the voucher and click **"Edit"** to make changes.

### How do I add a payee that's not in the directory?

If you see a **"Quick Add"** or **"Add New"** option, you can add payees on the fly. Otherwise, contact your administrator to add the payee to the directory.

### What information is required to create a voucher?

Required fields:
- Payee name (from directory)
- Payee address
- Particulars (payment description)
- Amount

Optional fields:
- Remarks
- Reference number

## Review and Approval

### How do I know when I have vouchers to review?

You'll receive notifications (bell icon 🔔) when vouchers need your review. Notifications auto-refresh every 30 seconds.

### What do RECEIVED, REVIEWED, and FORWARDED mean?

These are the three stages of review:
- **RECEIVED**: You acknowledge receipt of the voucher
- **REVIEWED**: You complete your review
- **FORWARDED**: You forward it to the next department

You must complete all three in order.

### Can I skip a stage?

No. The system requires you to complete RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED in order. This ensures proper tracking and accountability.

### Why is my review button disabled?

Possible reasons:
- Voucher hasn't reached your stage yet (previous stage not complete)
- Voucher has already passed your stage
- Voucher is cancelled

Check the approval progress bar to see current stage.

### How long should I take to review?

Review promptly when notified. Typical timeline:
- Secretary: 1-2 business days
- Mayor: 1-3 business days
- Budget/Accounting: 1-2 business days each

### What should I write in review comments?

Be specific and professional:
- ✅ "Verified payee information and amount"
- ✅ "Budget allocation confirmed, funds available"
- ❌ Avoid vague comments like "OK" or "Looks good"

## BAC Review

### How many BAC members need to review?

Default is 3 BAC members, but this is configurable by the administrator. You'll see "X out of Y approvers" status.

### Do I need to wait for other BAC members?

No! Each BAC member reviews independently. You can complete your review (RECEIVED → REVIEWED → FORWARDED) at your own pace. The voucher moves forward only after all required members complete.

### Can I see other BAC members' progress?

Yes! Check the approval progress bar and activity log to see:
- Which members have reviewed
- Their current stage
- Timestamps of their actions

### Why do I only see GSO vouchers for BAC review?

BAC review is only for procurement vouchers created by GSO. Regular office vouchers (from Requesters) and HR vouchers don't go through BAC.

---

## Treasury Processing

### What's the difference between Treasury and other reviewers?

Treasury uses a **three-step process** instead of three-stage review:
1. Check Number Issuance
2. Available for Release
3. Released

### When should I issue the check number?

Issue the check number when you're ready to prepare the check. This is the first step in Treasury processing.

### What if I don't have the check number yet?

You can wait until you have the check number before clicking "Issue Check Number." The voucher will remain at Treasury stage until you complete the steps.

### Can I mark a voucher as released before the check is actually given?

No. Only mark as **"Released"** when payment is actually released to the payee. This is the final step and should reflect actual payment.

## Status and Progress

### What do the status badges mean?

- **DRAFT**: Created but not submitted
- **PENDING**: Submitted, awaiting review
- **VALIDATED**: Secretary completed review
- **APPROVED**: Mayor approved, in department reviews
- **RELEASED**: Treasury released payment
- **CANCELLED**: Cancelled by authorized user

### How do I check voucher progress?

Open any voucher and look at the **Approval Progress** bar. It shows:
- Current stage
- Completed stages
- Progress percentage
- Timestamps

### Why is my voucher stuck at a certain stage?

Possible reasons:
- Reviewer hasn't completed all three stages
- Reviewer is on leave
- Technical issue

Check the activity log to see last action, then contact the department at that stage.

### How long does the entire process take?

Typically 5-12 business days from submission to release, depending on:
- Department workload
- Urgency
- Approval requirements

## Notifications

### How often do notifications update?

Notifications auto-refresh every 30 seconds. You can also manually refresh by clicking the notification bell.

### I'm not receiving notifications. Why?

Possible reasons:
- No vouchers currently need your action
- Browser notification settings
- Account notification preferences

Try refreshing the notification bell or contact administrator.

### Can I turn off notifications?

Notifications are important for workflow. If you need to adjust notification settings, contact your administrator.
